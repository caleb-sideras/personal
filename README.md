# Ideas

## Components
- Navigation rail/drawer
- Card
-  


## Component Design
- 'items' share mutiple functionality - as it is the lowest level of interaction. There should be a base class that can be extended
- 'lists' share mutiple functionality - some may need to be hidden while others need to various animations. Base class


## Styling

- Unsure on styling. Something mechanical, simple. Should only be 3-4 color profiles.
- Space - there will be big emphasis on spacing text, titles and components.
- Islands of iteractivity. Not only in the implementation, but with respective functionality



## design system idea

- black/white for main iteractivity
- offwhite and offblack (dark grey and grey) for secondary containers
- focus on ISLANDS! large areas cover with same background and/or border. border if iteractive elements, filled if visual.:
